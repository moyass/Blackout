# Blackout

## Goal
While watching media or playing video games, I needed a simple way to blackout the other monitors without affecting the window layouts I have in place. Sure I can reach to the power button and turn it off. That's too much work. Plus, in some cases that shifts around the Windows I have open. I don't want to readjust all my Window layouts.

## Usage
Primarily `Ctrl+4` is the toggle. You can change it in the code if you wish to. You are also able to toggle via the tray menu as well. 

Enjoy!
